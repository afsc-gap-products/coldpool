\description{
Summer bottom temperatures in the full eastern Bering Sea survey area, calculated from interpolation of temperature data from summer bottom trawl surveys conducted by AFSC/RACE/GAP. To load this data set, it is necessary to first load the coldpool package or terra package. Raster layers were interpolated using ordinary kriging with Matern covariance \doi{10.1007/978-1-4612-1494-6}{(Stein, 1999)}.
