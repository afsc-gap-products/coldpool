\description{
Summer bottom temperatures on the the eastern Bering Sea continental shelf survey area, calculated from interpolation of temperature data from summer bottom trawl surveys conducted by AFSC/RACE/GAP. To load ebs_summer_temperature, it is necessary to first load the coldpool package or raster and sp packages. Raster layers were interpolated using ordinary kriging with Matern covariance \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-1494-6}{(Stein, 1999)}.
